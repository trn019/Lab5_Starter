## Check My Understanding Questions
1. I would use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application because I would want to clarify if specific functions are implemented correctly. I would want to test if a message was successfully sent so I would implement a function that verifies if the message was sent and I would test if it returns true. 
2. I would use a unit test to the "max message length" feature of a message application because it is important to see if a message meets certain conditions (like character limits) or else they can't be sent. I would test if the program would provide me a false value for a message that is above the limit.
